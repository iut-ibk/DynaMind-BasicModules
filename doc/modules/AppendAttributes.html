<p>The Module intersects faces defined by a view with raster data field. Either the sum or the mean value of the cells within a face is added as an user defined attribute to the face. To check if a cell is with a face the centroid of the cell is used (see <a href="#Figure 2">Figure 2</a>.)</p>

<p>As input data for raster data and a view containing faces are required. <a href="#Figure 3">Figure 3</a> shows the input dialog. If the data <em>in port</em> is connected to the data stream, a raster data set can be chosen with the <em>Raster Data</em> combo box. The view that contains the faces to which the new calculated attributes are added can be defined in the <em>Append To</em> combo box. In <em>Name of Attribute</em> the attribute name is defined. </p>
<p>You can select between sum or median values. Additional a <em>Multiplier</em> that is multiplied with calculated value can be defined. </p>
