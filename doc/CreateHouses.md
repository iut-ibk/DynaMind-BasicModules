#Detailed Description
CreateHouses creates a simple house placed in the centroid of the parcel and rotated in the direction of the minimal bounding box. To create the building we use a 
rectangular footprint that is extruded according to the number of stories defined. (story height = 3 m). Windows are created with a average distance of 5 m. 1.5 m in height and 1.0 m above floor. If the roof angle is < 10 degree an extra roof is create (see figure)
